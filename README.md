# Effect of Socioeconomic Status on Obesity

This dataset includes data on adult's diet, physical activity, and weight status from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This data is used for DNPAO's Data, Trends, and Maps database, which provides national and state specific data on obesity, nutrition, physical activity, and breastfeeding. The goal of this analysist is to compare the obesity rate in each state, and then perform a linear regression on the obesity rate for each educational status and the income bracket.

The data is taken from https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Behavioral/hn4x-zwk7. Please go to the cdc website for complete description of the dataset.

The idea and some of the codes of this project is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/spittman1248/effect-of-socioeconomic-status-on-obesity.
